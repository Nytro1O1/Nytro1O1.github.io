    	<h2>My First Book Review</h2>
	    <h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone--Book Review</h3>
	    <h4>By Nitin Krishnaswamy</h4>
	    <h5>Today I finally finished a book called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I found this story very interesting. The story is full of wizards and dark lords. It is about a boy named Harry Potter whose parents were killed by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. He goes to live with his aunt and uncle, Petunia, and Vernon Dursley. He also has to deal with their son Dudley. His aunt, uncle, and cousin all hate him for being a wizard. They pride themselves in being a perfectly normal family. In the beginning of the story though, Harry doesn’t know he is a wizard. He always thought that the strange things that happened to him were just coincidences. However, one day a giant man named Hagrid, visits the Dursleys. He tells Harry that he is a wizard, and has been accepted into Hogwarts, a school of wizards and witches. They go off to a place called Diagon Alley, to buy Harry his supplies for school, his wand and his owl. Hagrid hands him a ticket for the train to Hogwarts and sends him off. The next day he boards the train to Hogwarts where he meets a peculiar family called the Weasleys. He meets a boy named Ron Weasly and they become friends. When he reaches the school he meets a serious teacher named Professor McGonigall. She takes them to the sorting ceremony where they are sorted into one of 4 houses, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, and Ravenclaw. Harry is sorted into Gryffindor, along with Ron, and an annoying girl they met named Hermione. He also meets the potions master named Severus Snape who really hates him. A few months into Hogwarts he encounters a troll. He bravely saves Hermione from it along with Ron. They become friends soon after. He also is the first ever first year student in a century to ever be the seeker in quidditch, a wizarding sport involving broomsticks and many balls. One day however he discovers a giant 3-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Harry, Ron, and Hermione discover that it is guarding the Sorcerer's Stone. This stone can give immortality and gold to anyone who possesses it. It is currently owned by Nicholas Flamel. They also discover a plot to steal it. They think the person trying to steal is Professor Snape. They decide they need to thwart this plot. They go through a series of rooms filled with obstacles. In every room, he has to leave one of his friends behind. He finally reaches the end where he discovers not Snape, but Professor Quirrel, the squeaky defense against the dark arts teacher. They have a fight over the stone where Harry discovers that Lord Voldemort has possessed part of Quirrel’s body. He also learns that Quirrel can’t touch Harry without suffering extreme pain. Harry uses this to his advantage and wins the fight. He later tells all of this to Professor Dumbledore who is the Headmaster of the School. He then goes back to his friends and packs for home. This is the end of the story. Granted, I left out the smaller details that aren’t that important. All in all I would definitely recommend this book. It is a very fun read. Hope you enjoyed this book review. Stay tuned for the next one.</h5>
