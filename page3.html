I always wanted to learn how to be the perfect entrepreneur. I wanted to know what steps to take to become very successful. I believe that this course can teach exactly those things. Here is my experience on day 1 of the course.

	    <h2>Introduction</h2>

I am attending a seminar on how to be a better entrepreneur, which is hosted by Rutgers University. Today was the first class of the day. It was from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm. In the beginning of the class, the host James Barrood talked about what we were going to do in the class today. After he told us our schedule for the day, he let us hear from Frank D’Souzas, a co-founder of Cognizant Technology Solutions. 

	    <h2>Frank D’Souza: Cognizant Technology Solutions</h2>

Cognizant is a very successful company worth billions, that is also ranked in the top 200 of all the Fortune 500 companies. Frank talked about all the things he learned from his time as an entrepreneur and CEO of Cognizant. He also told us some main lessons. The first point he taught us was to always keep learning. He also said to turn your hobbies into jobs. That way you can make your jobs your hobbies. If you did this then whenever you are working you never actually feel like you are. This way your job will be fun.
	
	    <h2>Dream Team</h2>

Next we listened to  an entrepreneur Mukesh Patel who talked about how to make the perfect team for any company you might be in. He said that the perfect team consists of 7 key components. The founders/executives, the competition who may want to invest, your employees, board of directors, contributors/investors, experts, and finally, you. He also said that your team should always consist of people who are smarter than you. If you are the smartest person, then it is not a good team at all. He said that if you aren’t the smartest person in the room it will make you want to do more than what you would have if you were the smartest person. This brings me to the final point. Before Mukesh left, he said that you should always push yourself to the fullest.

	    <h2>Cooperation</h2>

After that, Diana Kyser talked about the best ways to cooperate with your teammates. She said the best way to cooperate was to listen to each other's ideas, and don’t rule any of them out. She also said no company can ever be successful without cooperation. Any company that can’t cooperate is bound for failure. She also said the one of the best ways to help with your cooperation and teamwork was to do exercises, and team building activities every now and then. This would help your team get back on track.

	    <h2>Social Media</h2>

Finally at the end of the class, we heard from three entrepreneurs Sree Sreenivasan, Judi Fox, and Mark Metry. They all were talking about the best way to share content. This means social media. They all had their own opinions on what platform is best. However they all agreed that different reasons call for different social media platforms. For business and professional work, Linkedin is the way to go. On the other hand, if you want to spread the news about your idea or company in a more personal way, they said Twitter as well as Instagram would almost always be more suited for those purposes. They also said when trying to spread the news, always send it through multiple platforms, to guarantee that many people have read about your idea/company. They finished off with saying that social media is the best way to share content about specific ideas.



The lesson came to an end with James telling us that these things that I just told you about are main points to becoming an entrepreneur. He told us that this is the end of the class and that he would be seeing us tomorrow.  Well that is it for now. I definitely learned loads from this class, And it is only the first class. I can’t wait to see what I learn tomorrow. Hope you enjoyed this blog on the Day 1 of the Global Entrepreneurial Experience(GEE). 
	
	    <h2>What I gained</h2>

I learned about how to form the perfect team, how to cooperate, how to communicate with others about a product I might be selling, and found a real life example of what all of this can achieve from the success of Cognizant. I had never known that for a dream team to be successful there has to be people smarter than you. I also did not know the key elements of the team. Using all of this information, if I should ever start a company, I would know exactly where to begin and would be set for success.

Well that is it for now. I definitely learned loads from this class, And it is only the first class. I can’t wait to see what I learn tomorrow. Hope you enjoyed reading this blog on the Day 1 of the Global Entrepreneurial Experience(GEE).
